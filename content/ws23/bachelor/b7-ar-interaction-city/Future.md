The topic of this project was to find out if its possible to combine real life interactions with an extended reality view. With the success of the three interactions (Button press, turning a know, exchangign elements) we can think about implementing new interactions. It would also be possible to think about changing the status of a physical object by an interaction in the XR-View.
